# Task Management Application (MERN Stack)

### Live demo https://task-management-mern-prod.onrender.com/

### ðŸ“š Project Overview
This is a full-featured **Task Management Application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It enables users to create, manage, and filter tasks efficiently while ensuring secure access and personalized functionality. The project is designed with **JWT-based authentication**, a live **due-date alert system**, and user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, the application is **fully optimized for mobile devices**, providing a seamless experience across all screen sizes. Users can also **visualize task statistics** through dynamic charts, making it easier to track task distribution and progress.

### ðŸš€ Features
### Authentication & Authorization
- Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure login and user access.
- Protected APIs: All task-related APIs are secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- Users must register or log in before accessing any application features.

### Task Management
- #### Add & Edit Tasks:
  - Users can create tasks with mandatory fields like title, description, priority, due date, and assignee.
  - Task status is optional and by default it will be "Todo".
  - Creator details will be added at the backend after validating user (JWT verify).
  - Built-in server validations ensure that due dates and assignee names are valid.
- #### Delete Tasks:
  - Only the creator of a task can delete it for secure task management.
- #### Labels/Tags:
  - Users can assign multiple labels/tags to tasks for better categorization.

### Comments
- Add comments to any task for better collaboration.
- Only the comment creator can edit or delete their comments.
- Comments are always sorted in a created-at-first order for better readability.

### Dashboard
- Tasks are listed with pagination for efficient browsing and management.
- Tasks are displayed in descending order of due date, showing the most urgent tasks first.

### Filtering & Sorting
- Powerful task filtering options:
  - By title, priority, status, due date, or assignee.
- Tasks are always sorted in a due-date-first order for better prioritization.

### Due Date Alerts
- Real-time alerts for tasks due today:
  - Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) to maintain a live connection between the server and client.
  - A cron scheduler on the server runs after every interval to send alerts for tasks due today.
  - Alerts are sent to the correct assignees in real-time.

### Task Stats
- Visualize task statistics for better tracking and analysis:
    - Provides insights into task distribution based on priority and status.
    - The user can view the number of tasks categorized by priority (Low, Medium, High) and by status (ToDo, In Progress, Done).
    - Stats help users monitor task progress and workload effectively.
