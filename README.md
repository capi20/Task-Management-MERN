# Task Management Application (MERN Stack)

### ðŸ“š Project Overview
This is a full-featured **Task Management Application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It enables users to create, manage, and filter tasks efficiently while ensuring secure access and personalized functionality. The project is designed with **JWT-based authentication**, a live **due-date alert system**, and user-friendly interfaces.

---

### ðŸš€ Features
### Authentication & Authorization
- Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure login and user access.
- Protected APIs: All task-related APIs are secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- Users must register or log in before accessing any application features.

### Task Management
- #### Add & Edit Tasks:
  - Users can create tasks with mandatory fields like title, description, priority, due date, and assignee. By default status will be Todo.
  - Built-in server validations ensure that due dates and assignee names are valid.
- #### Delete Tasks:
  - Only the creator of a task can delete it for secure task management.
- #### Labels/Tags:
  - Users can assign multiple labels/tags to tasks for better categorization.
 
### Comments
- Add comments to any task for better collaboration.
- Only the comment creator can edit or delete their comments.
- Comments are always sorted in a created-at-first order for better readability.

### Dashboard
- Tasks are listed with pagination for efficient browsing and management.
- Tasks are displayed in descending order of due date, showing the most urgent tasks first.

### Filtering & Sorting
- Powerful task filtering options:
  - By title, priority, status, due date, or assignee.
- Tasks are always sorted in a due-date-first order for better prioritization.

### Due Date Alerts
- Real-time alerts for tasks due today:
  - Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) to maintain a live connection between the server and client.
  - A cron scheduler on the server runs every 30 minutes to send alerts for tasks due today.
  - Alerts are sent to the correct assignees in real-time.

### User APIs
- Core user-related functionalities implemented:
  - Sign Up, Login, Logout, and Get Current User APIs.

### ðŸ“¦ API Endpoints
### Authentication
- **POST `/api/auth/register`** - Register a new user. {name, email, password}
- **POST `/api/auth/login`** - Log in an existing user. {email, password}
- **GET `/api/auth/logout`** - Log out the current user.
- **GET `/api/auth/getCurrentUser`** - Fetch the currently logged-in user.
### Tasks
- **GET `/api/tasks?page=1&limit=10`** - Fetch all tasks with pagination.
- **GET `/api/tasks/search?page=1&limit=10&title=abc`** - Fetch all tasks with filtering and pagination.
- **POST `/api/tasks`** - Add a new task with optional labels/tags. {title, description, priority, dueDate, assignee, labels: []}
- **GET `/api/tasks/:id`** - Get a task.
- **PUT `/api/tasks/:id`** - Edit a task.
- **DELETE `/api/tasks/:id`** - Delete a task (only by creator).
### Comments
- **POST `/api/tasks/comments`** - Add a comment to a task. {taskId, text}
- **PUT `/api/tasks/comments/`** - Edit a comment (only by creator). {commentId, text}
- **DELETE `/api/tasks/:id/comments/:commentId`** - Delete a comment (only by creator). (Here /:id is task id)
### Real-Time Alerts
- **GET `/api/reminders`** - Establishes an SSE connection for receiving real-time due date reminders.
